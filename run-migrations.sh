# Enhanced Sequelize Migration Runner
#
# This script provides a dual-method approach to running 
# database migrations with TypeScript support:
#
# 1. First tries using the standard Sequelize CLI
# 2. If that fails, falls back to our custom TypeScript
#    migration runner for direct execution
#
# Usage: ./run-migrations.sh
